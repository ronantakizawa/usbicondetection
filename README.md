This is an object detection ML model for USB icons built using Yolov8. 

The USB icon, a symbol represented with an arrow branching to three subarrows with a circle, triangle, and square, is used in modern tech products to indicate if a product has a USB port or a USB connector. 

Using this model, anyone can upload an image of a product and the model could detect if the product has USB connection by looking for the USB icon. This object detection model is useful for ecommerce product scanning to classify products as USB chargeable or not.
